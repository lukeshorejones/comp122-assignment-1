# Three Dice
Included is a basic game called Three Dice, and a calculator for tiered packages. Three Dice simulates a simple dice-rolling game between two players. The calculator takes inputs from the user and recommends one of three tiered packages to them - Bronze, Silver or Gold, for some subscription service.

# User Guide
