# COMP122 Assignment 1
This is the first object-oriented programming assignment I completed for the COMP122 module at University at Liverpool - the "three dice" game, and a calculator for tiered packages. The three dice game simulates a simple dice-rolling game between two players. The calculator takes inputs from the user and recommends one of three tiered packages to them - Bronze, Silver or Gold.

# User Guide
The application classes to be run are Game and AccountUser.

# What Did I Learn?
The purpose of this assignment was to test my ability to create class hierarchies and utilise polymorphism.
